<h3>Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.</h3>
<body> 
<p>The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more 
livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis,  
leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, 
creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. 
The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.
Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in our solar system.</p>
